# ripse-blog

RIdiculous PSEudo blogging platform written mostly in JS. Actually, it's just a
small piece of code loading posts stored in .json files. It is intended to be
put in VCS repository, but there's no need to do so..

Anyway, it was created for two reasons: learn js basics and make a system for a
personal site to host anywhere and store data in git. There could already be
such systems, and they could be better. But this works and data can be simply
converted into anything else.

## comments
There are no support for comment adding. It is probably possible to make
generation of vcs patch preparing and sending over email, but that would make it
premoderated and clumsy anyway.

Of course, implementing comments only for those who have access to the repos is
simple enough and could eventually be implemented.

## convenience tools
Maybe i'll make some simple posting tool later..
