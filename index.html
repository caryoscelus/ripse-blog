                <h2>Why is it so if site is so static?</h2>
                <p>Because this allows to host site anywhere without having to deal with tons of once generated or even manually created htmls.</p>
                <h2>What can you do?</h2>
                <p>If you really can't use JS for some reason like using console browser or even wget+less, you still technically can access content of this site. All posts are located in /posts/, data about them in <a href="content.json">content.json</a></p>
